# PHP SOLID Principles with Examples

This repository demonstrates the SOLID principles in PHP, offering both good and bad examples to enhance understanding. It's designed to show how to write maintainable and flexible object-oriented code and common pitfalls to avoid.

## Principles

The SOLID principles are:

- **S** - Single Responsibility Principle: A class should have one, and only one, reason to change.
- **O** - Open/Closed Principle: Objects or entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.
- **L** - Liskov Substitution Principle: Objects in a program should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes without altering the correctness of that program.
- **I** - Interface Segregation Principle: No client should be forced to depend on methods it does not use.
- **D** - Dependency Inversion Principle: High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.

Each principle is illustrated in its respective directory with example PHP files, accompanied by a detailed explanation.

## Getting Started

To get started:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to each principle's directory under `src`.
3. Review both good and bad examples to understand the application and violation of the principle.
